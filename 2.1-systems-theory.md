## Summary

This grid analyzes the relationship between ethical quandaries and affected individual systems in the Snowden leaks. With the leaks, there are many ethical concerns. Privacy and government invasiveness are related, and regard the question of if the government should invade privacy to improve security. These affect many systems, including government technical systems, internet, phone, sms, and large tech company systems, all of which were used to collect or retrieve this data. The final column represents peoples interaction with technology as a socio-technical system. Knowing that all of your is potentially insecure affects the way someone might use technology. It decreases the trust in the government and technology. Privacy and government invasiveness affect this system.

There is a question on if it was ethical for Snowden to view this top secret information, and why an employee like Snowden would have access. This is a quadary, because if is controversial if leaking sensitive information is worth it to tell the people that they are being violated. These ethical quandaries affect goverment tech systems and technical permission, as with the goverment tech systems, Snowden having access to top secret information seems like an ethical concern. The final ethical concern is that Snowden went to Russia with this data. The US and Russia having a bad relationship makes this a quandary, since Snowden had access to all of this secret info.
